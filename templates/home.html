        <p> Welcome to the webpage about our solar system! <br> 
		The Sun is a star at the center of our solar system. <br>
		It is an almost perfectly round sphere of burning hot plasma and creates its own magnetic field via the dynamo process. Also The Sun is one of the most important source of life to humans besides oxygen which is mostly provided by the ocean so basically without the ocean and the sun the human race would theoretically die in an instant. 
		The Sun is about 1.4 million kilometers in diameter and most of the sun is made up of about 73% hydrogen and about 25% helium. The Sun was created about 4.6 billion years ago by a gravitational collapse of matter within a large molecular cloud. Eventually the center of the sun became so hot and dense that The Sun achieved nuclear fusion. </p>
